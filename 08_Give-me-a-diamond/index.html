    <h1>Give Me A Diamond</h1>
    <p>
      Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and
      wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make
      this happen, he needs your help.
    </p>
    <h2>Task</h2>
    <p>
      You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed
      on the screen, using asterisk (*) characters. Trailing spaces should be
      removed, and every line must be terminated with a new line character
      `(\n)`.
    </p>
    <p>
      Return null/nil/None/... if the input is an even number or negative, as it
      is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.
    </p>
