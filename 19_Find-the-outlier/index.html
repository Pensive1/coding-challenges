    <h1>Find The Parity Outlier</h1>
    <p>
      You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could
      be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised
      of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single
      integer <code>N</code>. Write a method that takes the array as an argument
      and returns this "outlier" <code>N</code>.
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
            [2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] ->  11 (the only odd number)
            [160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] -> 160 (the only even number)
