      <h1>Duplicate Encoder</h1>
      <p>
        The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where
        each character in the new string is <code>"("</code> if that character
        appears only once in the original string, or <code>")"</code> if that
        character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore
        capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.
